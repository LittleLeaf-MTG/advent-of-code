# advent-of-code

Currently working through 2020 problems under the guidance of [Ryan](https://github.com/rytheo) while gaining familiarity with Python. Early solutions look amateurish even to me after having learned from later ones over the course of this endeavour. It would be worth my while to go back and revamp them with what I've learned, but probably equally worthwhile to hang onto the outmoded ones.
